Digital systems have more accuracy and reliability than analog

This is due to the nature of analog systems assuming values 
between two points. 
I.E output voltage 
0v - 5v in digital only 2 values
-10v - +10v analog any between 

Limitations of analog is base on hardware
digital allows redesign 

Analog collects floating points which which causes erros in 
calculation.( fractions to percent )

Digital system subsystems take form of a switching circuit

Combinational circuit : 
output values depend only on present value of inputs and not past

Sequential circuit :
depends on both present and past inputs values 

Inputs values need to be specified for Sequential
Have memory as it references past sequence of inputs 

Combinational no memory

Logic gates are basic buildng block for circuit
Relationship between input to output signals be described boolean alg

Laws & theorems of Boolean algebra show and describe behavior
of circuits of logic gates.

First step designing combinational logic circuit
Derive table or algebraic logic equation
This describes the circuit output as a function of circuit input

logic equation which describe circuit outputs must be simplified

flip-flops are the basic memory elements used in design of sequential circuits
Can be interconnected with gates to form counters & registers

First step in design is to construct state table or graph.
This describes the relationship between input & output sequences.

sequential circuits design in txt are synchronous sequential
Common timing signal called clock used for synchronize operation of memory

Binary & number systems are natural to digital systems

Binary coded decimal (BCD) is the representation of numbers in binary

VHDL = VHSIC hardware describe language
VHSIC = very high speed integrated circuit
