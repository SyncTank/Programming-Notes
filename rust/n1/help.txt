cargo new <project_name>


Cargo.toml is the manifest file for Rust. 
It’s where you keep metadata for your project, as well as dependencies.

src/main.rs is where we’ll write our application code.

cargo new generates a "Hello, world!" project for us!
We can run this program by moving into the new directory that we made and running this in our terminal:
cargo run


You should see this in your terminal:

$ cargo run
   Compiling hello-rust v0.1.0 (/Users/ag_dubs/rust/hello-rust)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.34s
     Running `target/debug/hello-rust`
Hello, world!


In this project, we’ll use a crate called ferris-says. 
[dependencies]
ferris-says = "0.2"
We can also do this by running cargo add ferris-says@0.2.
cargo build
You’ll see that running this command created a new file for us, Cargo.lock. 
This file is a log of the exact versions of the dependencies we are using locally.

To use this dependency, we can open main.rs, remove everything that’s in there (it’s just another example), and add this line to it:

use ferris_says::say;

This line means that we can now use the say function that the ferris-says crate exports for us.
